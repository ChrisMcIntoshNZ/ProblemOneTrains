# ProblemOneTrains

Assumptions:

1. All names are single letters.
2. All numbers are integers.
3. You need to take at least one edge to count as a route.
4. It is not valid to have an edge from a node to itself.

To use Kiwiland-Trains Launch the program and enter a graph in a comma separated list of edges in the form AB5, where A is the name of the starting node and B is the name of the end node. e.g. "AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7".

Then hit "Load Graph" this will load the graph you have entered and enable the other functions.

The first Function will get you the distance of a Path of Node names separated by “-“ e.g. A-B-C. Just enter a path and hit "Get Distance".

The second function will get you the number of routes between two distances given a minimum and maximum number of stops, just enter the Start Node, End Node, Min Stops, Max Stops and hit "Get Number of Routes".

The third function will get you the number of routes under a given distance (exclusive). Just enter the Start Node, the End Node and the Distance and press “Get Number of Routes".

The final section will get you the distance shortest route between two nodes. Just enter the Start Node, the End Node and press “Get Shortest Route Length”.
